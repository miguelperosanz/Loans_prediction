# Loans_prediction

Creation of a model based on historical data loans in order to predict if a borrower would potentially pay back a loan. The data will be explored at the beginning and afterwards we will use tensorflow for the simulation. We will check the success of the system by means of a confusion matrix and a classification report.

The data is from a subset of the LendingClub DataSet and was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

This exercise is part of the hands-on activity of the awesome online course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" from Jose Portilla. I really enjoyed checking the potential applications of the machine learning principles in the real life. The fundamentals of this exercise might be potentially interesting for the usual loan activity of the banks.
